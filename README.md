[Project Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RWPXizD14y1B96HBsfQrkJM9EXluUjSgxPPgz4rqafM/edit?usp=sharing) is here.

## Description
1. Use SASS, Vue, AJAX, databases and Fetch to create a dynamic one-page app based on our class build. 
2. Click on one of the Mini models to show more content / data about that model. 
3. Use Vue lifecycle hooks, components, and AJAX where appropriate.

## Assignment Requirements:
1. Create an AJAX request for the mini data housed in your database using the Fetch API or the XHTTP object. Use that application state to build out your application’s view (the mini apps plash/home page).
2. Your XHTTP / Fetch function should handle the stages of an AJAX request gracefully - give some feedback if the request fails (use separate functions / handlers for each stage of an AJAX request). Most importantly, handle failure first - what happens if you can’t connect, if the resource is missing, etc. This is UX / UI - give the user some visual feedback.
3. If the AJAX request is successful, build out your view - the content of the page - using the response data (the application state).
4. Optional - use components where you can: each car should be a component, with its own data. When you click on one of the cars, use the data associated with the selection to populate another view with that data (think lightbox, a slider / popover - whatever you like). There should be additional videos to view at this stage as well (you might consider using an additional AJAX request to a separate table at this point).
5. Create some additional UI where appropriate. Think about microtransactions and UI enhancements that can guide the user through this process.
